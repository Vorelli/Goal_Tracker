//  Ambitions are a very broad sort of goal. I want to be able
//  to help people follow and accomplish their ambitions.
//  For example:
//  'Go pro in LoL' is a very broad and not clear ambition.
//  It can be broken down into several clearer goals in order to
//  be able to achieve it.
//  Like reaching grandmasters, getting into LoL Scouting Grounds,
//  etc. I feel like the purpose of a goal tracker is to be able
//  to organize and be able to make a clear path forward in order
//  to accomplish an ambition or something.
//
//  How I want to organize the project's layout visually:
//  Ambitions   ->  Goals   ->  Tasks   (->)    Sub-Tasks (Same as Tasks code-wise as this chain can go on infinitely)
//Large underlying goal
//   A smaller, more attainable accomplishment
//        Something that can be completed without much thought as to 'how?'
//                              Something as basic as 'brush teeth'
