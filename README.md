//  Ambitions are a very broad sort of goal. I want to be able  
//  to help people follow and accomplish their ambitions.  
//  For example:  
//  'Go pro in LoL' is a very broad and not clear ambition.  
//  It can be broken down into several clearer goals in order to  
//  be able to achieve it.  
//  Like reaching grandmasters, getting into LoL Scouting Grounds,  
//  etc. I feel like the purpose of a goal tracker is to be able  
//  to organize and be able to make a clear path forward in order  
//  to accomplish an ambition or something.  
//  
//  How I want to organize the project's layout visually:  
//  Ambitions   ->  Goals   ->  Tasks   (->)    Sub-Tasks (Same as Tasks code-wise as this chain can go on infinitely)  
//Large underlying goal  
//   A smaller, more attainable accomplishment  
//        Something that can be completed without much thought as to 'how?'  
//                              Something as basic as 'brush teeth'
